                                    Loch Lomond is a freshwater loch which crosses the Highland Boundary Fault, often considered the boundary between the lowlands of Central Scotland and the Highlands. It's southern shores are about 23 km (14 mi) northwest of the centre of Glasgow, Scotland's largest city.The Loch forms part of the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park which was established in 2002.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    The Kelpies are horse-head sculptures depicting kelpies (shape-shifting water spirits), located in near Falkirk, standing next to a new extension to the Forth and Clyde Canal, and near River Carron. The sculptures were designed by sculptor Andy Scott and were completed in October 2013. The Kelpies are a monument to horse-powered heritage across Scotland.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The sculptures were opened to the public in April 2014. As part of the project, they have their own visitor centre, and sit beside a newly developed canal turning pool and extension. This canal extension reconnects the Forth and Clyde Canal with the River Forth, and improves navigation between the East and West of Scotland.

                                    Kilchurn Castle is a ruined structure on a rocky peninsula at the northeastern end of Loch Awe, in Argyll and Bute. It was first constructed in the mid-15th century as the base of the Campbell's of Glenorchy, who extended both the castle and their territory in the area over the next 150 years.

                                    After the Campbell's became Earls of Breadalbane and moved to Taymouth Castle, Kilchurn fell out of use and was in ruins by 1770. It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland and is open to the public in summer.

                                    Access is either by boat from Lochawe pier, or on foot from the A85 near Dalmally. The access is under the railway viaduct that crosses Loch Awe. The castle is a scheduled monument.

                                    The Forth Bridge, which carries the main east coast rail line, first opened in 1890 and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Forth Road Bridge is a suspension bridge which, when opened in 1964, was the largest in the world outside the United States. The newest bridge, the Queensferry Crossing, opened in 2017 and is the longest three-tower, cable-stayed bridge in the world.

                                    Dunnottar Castle is a ruined medieval fortress located on a rocky headland about 2 miles (3 km) south of Stonehaven. The surviving buildings are largely of the 15th and 16th centuries, but the site is believed to have been fortified in the Early Middle Ages. Dunnottar has played a prominent role in the history of Scotland through to the 18th-century Jacobite risings because of its strategic location and defensive strength.

                                    Dunnottar is best known as the place where the Honours of Scotland, the Scottish crown jewels, were hidden from Oliver Cromwell's invading army in the 17th century.

                                    The ruins of the castle are spread over 1.4 hectares, surrounded by steep cliffs that drop to the North Sea, 160 feet below. A narrow strip of land joins the headland to the mainland, along which a steep path leads up to the gatehouse. The various buildings within the castle include the 14th-century tower house as well as the 16th-century palace.

                                    Buachaille Etive Mòr (meaning "the herdsman of Etive"), is a mountain at the head of Glen Etive. Its pyramidal form, as seen from the A82 road when travelling towards Glen Coe, makes it one of the most recognisable mountains in Scotland, and one of the most photographed.

                                    Buachaille Etive Mòr takes the form of a ridge nearly five miles (8 km) in length, almost entirely encircled by the River Etive and its tributaries. The ridge contains four principal tops, the highest of which is Stob Dearg at 1021 metres.

                                    Bow Fiddle Rock is a natural sea arch near Portknockie on the Moray Firth coast. It is so called because it resembles the tip of a fiddle bow.

                                    It is composed of Quartzite, a metamorphic rock which was originally quartz sandstone. The formation is some 2,400m thick and dates from the Neoproterozoic Era, 1,000 to 541 million years ago.

                                    Eilean Donan is recognised as one of the most iconic images of Scotland  all over the world. Situated on an island at the point where three great sea lochs meet, and surrounded by some majestic scenery, it is little wonder that the castle is now one of the most visited and important attractions in the Scottish Highlands.

                                    The first fortified castle was built in the mid 13th century and stood guard over the lands of Kintail. Since then, at least four different versions of the castle have been built and re-built as the feudal history of Scotland unfolded through the centuries.

                                    Partially destroyed in a Jacobite uprising in 1719, Eilean Donan lay in ruins for the best part of 200 years until Lieutenant Colonel John MacRae-Gilstrap bought the island in 1911 and proceeded to restore the castle to its former glory. The castle was re-opened in 1932.

                                    The Cuillin is a range of rocky mountains located on the Isle of Skye. The main Cuillin ridge is also known as the Black Cuillin to distinguish it from the Red Cuillin, which lie to the east of Glen Sligachan. The scenic beauty of the Cuillin has led to it being designated a national scenic area,one of 40 such areas in Scotland.

                                    The Black Cuillin are mainly composed of gabbro and basalt. The rocks are dark in colour. The main ridge forms a narrow crest,with steep cliffs and scree slopes. The ridge is about 14 km long and curves in an irregular semi-circle around Loch Coruisk, which lies at the heart of the range. The highest point is Sgùrr Alasdair in the Black Cuillin at 992 m (3,255 ft).

                                    The Red Cuillin are mainly composed of granite with a reddish tinge and have weathered into more rounded hills with vegetation cover to summit level and long scree slopes on their flanks. These hills are lower and less rocky. The highest point of the red hills is Glamaig (775 m).

                                    An Teallach lies to the southwest of Dundonnell and overlooks Little Loch Broom, in an area often nicknamed the "great wilderness". An Teallach means 'The Anvil' or 'The Forge' in Scottish Gaelic. This fabled mountain is perhaps the most impressive in Britain, and gives a day of drama and views that will live in the memory forever.

                                    The mountain is mostly made of Torridonian sandstone. An Teallach has terraced sides riven with steep gullies and a sharp rocky summit crest at Sgùrr Fiona. The steepest section, known as Corrag Bhuidhe, rises above Loch Toll an Lochain. Corrag Bhuidhe's most spectacular feature is an overhanging pinnacle known as Lord Berkeley's Seat.

                                    An Teallach is a complex mountain massif, with ten distinct summits over 3,000 feet (914m). Sgùrr Fiona is the highest summit at 1,062 metres (3,486 ft).

                                    Suilven is a mountain in a remote area in the west of Sutherland. It rises from a wilderness landscape of moorland, bogs, and lochans known as Inverpolly National Nature Reserve. Suilven forms a steep-sided ridge some 2 km in length. The highest point, Caisteal Liath ("Grey Castle" in Scottish Gaelic), lies at the northwest end of this ridge at an elevation of 731 metres (2,398 ft)

                                <p>
                                    There are two other summits: Meall Meadhonach ("Middle Round Hill") at the central point of the ridge is 723 m high, whilst Meall Beag ("Little Round Hill") lies at the southeastern end

                                <p>
                                    Geologically, Suilven is formed of Torridonian sandstone, sitting on a landscape of Lewisian Gneiss. The surrounding rocks were eroded during an episode of glaciation. The flow of ice created the distinctive narrow teardrop shape, while carving and scouring the vertical sides of the mountain.
