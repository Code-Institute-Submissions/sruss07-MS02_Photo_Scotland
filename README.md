### UX

The website is targeted at photographers of all abilities. From professionals looking to enhance their portfolios, to experienced amateurs seeking new challenges. From new, inexperienced amateurs deciding on their favourite photography genre, to tourists who enjoy recording their vacations through their photography. The priority of the site is to focus on location information,images and maps and also to enable visitors to subscribe to a mailing list, complete a contact form and join related social media sites.

#### 1. Strategy

>
> ##### Project Goals:
>
> - Showcase 12 of the most stunning landscape photography locations that Scotland has to offer.
> - Promoting Scotland as a must visit country for outstanding landscape photograpy.
> - To increse the numbers of visitors interested in visiting Scotland for landscape photography through subscriptions to mailing list and the consequent increase of the customer database.
> - Social media links to increase user interaction through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Pinterest.
>
> ##### Customer Goals:

> Location details are presented in short and relevant paragraphs to provide users with the required level of information.
> The site will utilise a set of high quality images to highlight each photography location.
> Introduction information for Scotland including population, capital city, other cities, land area, highest point, number of islands and number of lochs.
> Contact Us information is provided via email contact form with an optional newsletter subscription.
> Links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Pinterest social media websites in the fÃŸooter.

#### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wireframes](https://github.com/sruss07/MS02_Photo_Scotland/blob/master/assets/docs/Photo%20Scotland%20wireframes.pdf): One-page website with **4** main sections.
> - Fixed navigation bar with link headings pointing to each of the 4 section.
> - Fixed navigation bar links headings collapse to menu icon on smaller screen sizes.
> - Home, About Scotland, Locations and Contact Us sections
> - Footer with social media icon links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Pinterest.

#### 5. Surface

### Testing

> Testing documentation can be found on a separate document [HERE](https://github.com/sruss07/MS02_Photo_Scotland/blob/master/assets/docs/Testing.md)

### Project barriers and solutions

> - I encountered two barriers which slowed my overall progress, partly due to personal circumstances which affected the time I could devote to my project, and also due to my poor grasp of Javascript.
> - Firstly, I found getting the locations dropdown buttons to link to their associated information paragraphs to be troublesome. Writing a suitable javascript function for this to be a challenge. Due to personal circumstances which led to time restrictions, I was not able to complete this functionality as I was planning to.
 - Secondly, I had some problems with coding the maps API sections of my project to allow the maps to display in the correct way. The two things I wanted to implement were fixing the bounds of the map, and a zoom function to each marker. Again, due to the reason mentioned above I was unable to get the maps to behave exactly as I had planned.

### Version Control

> -  Git was used for version control.

---

### Deploying My Project 

> I created my Milestone Project 2 on GitHub and used GitPod's development environment to write my HTML, CSS and Javascript code.

> All code was written on Gitpod. The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/sruss07/MS02_Photo_Scotland).

> So that my project was viewable to others it was then deployed to GitHub Pages using the following process:

> 1. Opened the 'Settings' section of the project repository in GitHub.
> 2. Scrolled to the 'GitHub Pages' section.
> 3. Selected 'master branch' as the Source.
> 4. This deployed the project on GitHub Pages and thus enabled me to share the live website with others. 

> My live project can be viewed by folowing this link: [Photo Scotland]( https://sruss07.github.io/MS02_Photo_Scotland/.)
