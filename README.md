### UX

The website is targeted at photographers of all abilities. From professionals looking to enhance their portfolios, to experienced amateurs seeking new challenges. From new, inexperienced amateurs deciding on their favourite photography genre, to tourists who enjoy recording their vacations through their photography. The priority of the site is to focus on location information,images and maps and also to enable visitors to subscribe to a mailing list, complete a contact form and join related social media sites.

#### 1. Strategy

> The UX is user-friendly with a easy to follow navigation journey which allows the user to reach relevant sections and information with the minimum number of interactions with the site
>
> ##### Project Goals:
>
> - Showcase 12 of the most stunning landscape photography locations that Scotland has to offer.

> - Demonstrates my current ability and knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and API use.

#### 3. Structure

> Location details are presented in short and relevant paragraphs to provide users with the required level of information.
> The site will utilise a set of high quality images to highlight each photography location.
> Introduction information for Scotland including population, capital city, other cities, land area, highest point, number of islands and number of lochs.
> Contact information is provided via email contact form with an optional newsletter subscription.
> Links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Pinterest social media websites in the fÃŸooter.

#### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wireframes]: One-page website with **4** main sections.
> - Fixed navigation bar with link headings pointing to each of the 4 section.
> - Fixed navigation bar links headings collapse to menu icon on smaller screen sizes.
> - Home, About Scotland, Locations and Contact sections

### Version Control

> -  Git was used for version control.

---

### Deploying My Project 

> I created my Milestone Project 1 on GitHub and used GitPod's development environment to write my HTML, CSS and Javascript code.

> All code was written on Gitpod. The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my [Repository](https://github.com/sruss07/MS02_Photo_Scotland).

> So that my project was viewable to others it was then deployed to GitHub Pages using the following process:

> 1. Opened the 'Settings' section of the project repository in GitHub.
> 2. Scrolled to the 'GitHub Pages' section.
> 3. Selected 'master branch' as the Source.
> 4. This deployed the project on GitHub Pages and thus enabled me to share the live website with others. 

> My live project can be viewed by folowing this link: [Photo Scotland]()
